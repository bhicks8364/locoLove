            <li>Lorain Count Muisc Founation wishes to provide an outlet for local aspiring & established musicians of all ages, genres & experience levels to perform in a safe & positive environment.</li>
            <li>Our ultimate goal is to establish a childrenâ€™s day camp that would provide music therapy for underprivileged & special needs children in the area</li>
            <li>In addition to creating a day camp for kids, we plan to begin a program with the local high schools & colleges to help students to earn school credit <br>
                by volunteering & doing something they love...all while building their skills & finishing their degree.</li>
